* Relational Data Model

** Relational Data Model

A *relation schema* $R(A_a, ..., A_n)$ is a relation name $R$ and a list of attributes $A_1, ..., A_n$.

Each attribute $A_i$ is the name of a role played by some domain $D$.

- Example:  $AUTHOR(author\_id, first\_name, last\_name)$

    - $dom(A_1)$ (or $dom(author\_id)$) is integer

A *database schema* is a collection of relation schemas.

- Example: $PUBS$ database has relation schemas $BOOK$, $AUTHOR$, and $PUB$ (for publication, not public house)


** Relations and Databases

A *relation*, or *relation state*, $r(R)$ is a **set** of tuples that conform to a *relation schema* $R$.

- Example: $r(AUTHOR)$ =


    +-----------+------------+-----------+
    | author_id | first_name | last_name |
    +-----------+------------+-----------+
    |         1 | John       | McCarthy  |
    |         4 | Claude     | Shannon   |
    |         5 | Alan       | Turing    |
    |         6 | Alonzo     | Church    |
    +-----------+------------+-----------+


A *database* is a set of relations.

** Tuples

A *tuple* is an **ordered list** of values that is part of a relation

- Example: $t_1 =$ <1, 'John', 'McCarthy'>

Each value in the tuple is that tuple's value for the corresponding attribute of the relation schema.

Example: (these are equivalent notations):

- $t_1[first\_name] =$ 'John' (bracket notation)
- $t_1.first\_name =$ 'John' (object notation)
- $t_1[2] =$ `'John'` (positional notation)

The *degree* or *arity* of a relation schema is the number of attributes it has.

- Example: $AUTHOR$ has degree 3.

** Attributes and Domains

Each attribute has a name and a *domain*

- The name describes the role played by the attribute

    - Example: the $first\_name$ attribute of the $AUTHOR$ schema plays the role of the first name of an author represented by a tuple in a $r(AUTHOR)$ relation.

- The domain is a set of atomic values that a tuple may have for that attribute.

- A *logical definition* of a domain specifies a simple type such as integer or string, and a *data type* or *format*

  - Example: ~USA_phone_number~ as $(ddd) ddd-dddd$, where $d$ is a digit

** Mathematical Definition of Relation

Given $R(A_1, ..., A_n)$,

- $r(R) \subseteq (dom(A_1) \times dom(A_2) \times ... \times dom(A_n))$

The total number of values, or *cardinality*, of a domain $D$ is $|D|$.

So the maximum number of tuples that could possibly be in $r(R)$ is

- $|dom(A_1)| * |dom(A_2)| * ... * |dom(A_n)|$

** Properties of Relations

- Atomicity of values, i.e., the First Normal Form assumption

    - Attribute values in tuples are indivisible, e.g., no compound or multivalued attributes as in EER models

- Nulls

    - Unknown, not applicable, not existing

- Closed world assumption

    - Facts not asserted explicitly are assumed to be false

** Kinds of Constraints

- Inherent model-based (or *implicit*) constraints

    - domain constraints, atomic attribute values

- Schema-based (or *explicit*) contstraints

    - keys, referential integrity

- Application-based (or semantic constraints), a.k.a., business rules

** Superkeys

A *superkey* $SK$ is a set of attributes of a relation schema $R$ such that

#+BEGIN_CENTER
$t_i[SK] \ne t_j[SK]$
#+END_CENTER

for any $i \ne j$.

In other words, the values of the superkey attributes of a tuple uniquely identify the tuple within the relation.

By the definition of the relational model, the full attribute set of a relation schema is a *default superkey*.

** Keys

A *minimal superkey* is a superkey for which removing an attribute would make it no longer a superkey.

We call a minimal superkey a *key*.

A relation schema may have several keys. We call these *candidate keys* and choose one arbitrarily to be the *primary key*.

We underline the primary key in a relation schema.

- Example: $AUTHOR(\underline{author\_id}, first\_name, last\_name)$

** Database Integrity Constraints

- Domain constraints - Attribute values in tuples must be in domain for that attribute

- Key constraints - No two tuples can have the same values for the primary key

- Entity Integrity Constraints - No tuple can have a NULL value for its primary key attribute

- Referential Integrity Constraints - Tuples in one relation referencing tuples in another relation

- Semantic Integrity Constraints - Constraints on values of attributes that cannot be specified in the databases DDL

** Referential Integrity Constraints

A foreign key value from a tuple in one relation must refer to nothing, or to the primary key for an existing tuple in another relation. Formally:

Given relation schemas $R_1$ and $R_2$, a set of attributes $FK$ in $R_1$ is a foreign key referencing $R_2$ if

- the attributes in $FK$ in $R_1$ have same domains as $PK$ in $R_2$
- Given some $t_1$ in $r_1(R_1)$ and $t_2$ in $r_2(R_2)$, either $t_1[FK]$ = $t_2[PK]$ or $t_1[FK]$ is NULL.

$R_1$ is the referencing relation, $R_2$ is the referenced relation.

** Diagramming FK Relationships

** Semantic Integrity Constraints

- Can't be specified in DDL
- Can be checked with triggers and assertions
- Usually checked in application code

Example: salary of an employee cannot exceed the salary of the employee's supervisor.

** Constraint Violations on Insert

- Domain constraints

    - Insert a tuple with an attribute value not in attribute's domain

- Key constraints

    - Insert a tuple with a key that's already in the relation state

- Entity integrity constraints

    - Insert a tuple with a NULL value for any part of the primary key

- Referential integrity constraints

    - Insert a tuple in a referring relation whose FK does not appear as a PK value in any tuple of the referenced relation

** Constraint Violations on Update

- Domain constraints

    - Update a tuple with an attribute value not in attribute's domain

- Key constraints

    - Update a tuple with a key value that already appears in another tuple in the relation

- Entity integrity constraints

    - Update a tuple with a NULL value for any part of the primary key

- Referential integrity constraints

    - Update a tuple in a refferring relation with a FK does not appear as a PK value in any tuple of the referenced relation
    - Update the primary key for a tuple in a referenced relation for which there are tuples in referring relationships. The tuples in referring relationships would be orphaned or end up referring to the wrong parent tuple.

** Constraint Violations on Delete

- Referential integrity

  - Delete a tuple in a referenced relationship for which there are tuples in referring relationships. The tuples in referring relationships would be orphaned.


** Domain Integrity Violation Examples

    +-----------+------------+-----------+
    | author_id | first_name | last_name |
    +-----------+------------+-----------+
    |         1 | John       | McCarthy  |
    |         4 | Claude     | Shannon   |
    |         5 | Alan       | Turing    |
    |         6 | Alonzo     | Church    |
    +-----------+------------+-----------+

$dom(author_id) = integer, dom(first_name) = string, dom(last_name) = string$

- Insert $<"Two", "Jenny", "McCarthy">$ -- $"Two"$ is not in $dom(author_id)$
- Update $<1, "John", "McCarthy">$ to $<1, "John", 1>$-- $1$ is not in $dom(last_name)$

** Key Integrity Violation Examples

    |           5 | Alan       | Turing    |
    |           6 | Alonzo     | Church    |
    +-------------+------------+-----------+

- Insert $<1, "Jenny", "McCarthy">$ -- $1$ is an existing primary key
- Update $<1, "John", "McCarthy">$ to $<6, "John", "McCarthy">$-- $6$ is an existing primary key

** Entity Integrity Violation Examples


    +-------------+------------+-----------+
    | _author_id_ | first_name | last_name |
    +-------------+------------+-----------+
    |           1 | John       | McCarthy  |
    |           4 | Claude     | Shannon   |

    |           6 | Alonzo     | Church    |
    +-------------+------------+-----------+

- Insert $<NULL, "Jenny", "McCarthy">$ -- $NULL$ not allowed for primary key
- Update $<NULL, "John", "McCarthy">$ to $<1, "John", 1>$-- $NULL$ not allowed for primary key
